# Using-sophisticated-images-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
Real-world data using the Cats v Dogs dataset from an old Kaggle Data Science challenge.


# >>> Part-1 :
Used small dataset.
Problem-Overfitting, despite great results with the training set.
One solution to overfitting is to use more data for both training and validation - Part 2.

# >>> Part-2 :
Addressing the problem in Part-1.
built a classifier using the full Cats v Dogs dataset of 25k images.
